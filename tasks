Friendship:
- add a nice feed with the possibility to add, pictures, text, like strava

Activities:
- add specific entry for each sports. For example, cycling we can add distance, time, avg speed and total ascent.
- 

Bugs:
- adding a new weight does change it in the database but we do not see the 'distance from objective' change
- the buttons are not the same for modifying an activity and for modifying a weight. They shall be exactly the same.

Dark mode bugs:
- The boxes for the activity and weight history are not blackened by the theme and are still white, thus ilisible
- The box for the explanation of the adaptation is not blackened by the theme and are still white, thus illisible
- The box that show the friends are not blackened by the theme and still white
- some of the boxes have a white contour while some have not, we need to make it uniform, all boxes in dark mode shall have a nice minimalistic contour.
- When we click on a dropdown box, what is inside the dropdown is not in darkmode so we cant read or select anything

Remember me functionality:
- the remember me functionality does not work as intended as it seems it only saves one device right ? Can you explain how this functionality works so i can decide how to improve it
